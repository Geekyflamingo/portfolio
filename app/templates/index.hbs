        <strong>What do I love?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I love to learn new and exciting things, which is why I am currently attending gSchool to become a developer. I love the outdoors! Everything about it, hiking, camping, snowshoeing you name it.
        I also horseback-ride, ice skate, and do pilates.
        I enjoy fine liqours and learning about the distilling and history of each one.

        <strong>What is my background?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Colorado School of Mines in Geology and Geological Engineering. I went to work for a geological software company that consulted on large mining projects.
        I loved working with all the people to see what problem I could solve for them. I used vast amounts of technology from cameras and computers to handheld GPS units and units the company made.
        I then switched to work for the State of Colorado in the Air Pollution Control Division Oil and Gas sector. Technology was non existent or old there and I yearned for a useable online presence.

        I was fortunate to stumble upon gSchool and decided a move was neccessary. I wanted to learn the newest thing on the tech scene.
        I found myself loving to solve problems that were given to me and ones that I found myself.
        I tried to take a process and see how to make it better, more efficeint.

        <strong>What do I want to do?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The long and short of it is: I want to create, I want to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love creating new things and improving upon what's already there.
        I love designing web apps that are functional, easy to use and interesting.
        Overall I want a web app that makes the end user happy.
